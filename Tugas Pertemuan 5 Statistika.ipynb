Chebyshev’s theorem tells you that no matter how the scores are distributed, a certain percentage of scores will always be within a certain range around the average. For example, at least 75% of scores are within two standard deviations (a measure of spread) from the average.\n",

But if you flip it many, many times, you're likely to get closer to a 50/50 split. The more you flip, the closer you will get to the expected 50% heads and 50% tails. This theorem reassures us that averages calculated from large samples are reliable and represent the whole population well.\n"

However, if you keep taking samples of, say, 50 people, and calculate the average height of each sample, those averages will form a bell curve (normal distribution), even if the original height data didn't look like a bell curve at all. This is super useful because it allows statisticians to apply many statistical tools that assume data is normally distributed.\n",
